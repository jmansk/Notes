## Raw Ideas
- Building your own firewall is easier than you think — OPNsense demystified
- Most “enterprise” firewall boxes are just locked-down Linux with a sticker
- VLANs and subnets: the truth about their relationship (and how MSPs screw it up)
- Why removing complexity is the most powerful security tool
- Obsidian as a second brain for technical founders
- The real reason MSPs burn out: no boundary between process and chaos
- Why flat-rate support + scoped extras is the future of lean IT
-  VPN as a Service: Shield-in-the-cloud offering for remote-first orgs
- ShieldTrust Report: Monthly email that shows exactly what was blocked/prevented
- Turning ticket-based support into form-driven self-service
- “CE-ready by design” — How to build networks that pass CE before the audit
- Using hosted OPNsense to enforce DNS and conditional access trust location

## Quotes
> “If you don’t charge for cleanup, you’ll do it anyway — and resent it.”

> “You do with one brain and one box what they do with five departments and a spreadsheet.”

> “We’re not just your IT support — we’re the trust layer between your people and your systems.”

> “You can’t run a secure network on a tenant built by four interns and a SharePoint wizard.”

> “Clients don’t care if the backend is chaos — until the day it burns.”

> “If the VPN’s not running, they don’t work. That’s the rule.”

> “I don’t manage firewalls. I deploy trust boundaries.”

 > “You shouldn’t support users who disable security to work. You should design it so they don’t have to.”
## Rants / Fire Takes
- Ticket-based MSP support models are broken. Automate it or die.
- Why most support contracts are just a tax on bad configuration
- MSPs are still solving problems that shouldn’t exist anymore
- Nobody wants to log into a VPN. Make it automatic or don’t sell remote access.

## Personal Learnings / Founder Voice
- “I thought I understood networking — until I started building one from scratch.”
- “My brain only works when I document as I build. Obsidian and Git are now non-negotiable.”
- “Shield isn’t a firewall. It’s an opinion, enforced at wire speed.”
