Can we provision VPN keys silently, attach them to a user’s device, and fire up the tunnel automatically on Windows login — without any UI?

Use cases:
- Seamless always-on VPN for Shield clients
- Great for remote-first firms who hate clunky SSL portals
- Combined with CA policy enforcement

Challenges:
- Windows service timing
- Key delivery without user access
- Device trust + identity linkage
