# How to Keep Your IT Simple — And Why Most Businesses Still Overcomplicate It

## Intro

Most small businesses only have five or six job roles: Admin, Finance, Sales, Operations, Directors, maybe a few specialists.

But their Microsoft 365 tenant often looks like a mess: dozens of groups, tangled permissions, and no clear structure.

Why does that matter?

Because avoidable IT problems cost real time.  
📊 According to research by Robert Half, employees lose nearly **91 hours a year** to IT issues — that’s over **11 full workdays**, per person, per year.  
Much of that stems from inconsistent access, messy systems, and avoidable mistakes.

Let’s fix that.

## Think of Your IT Like an Office Building

You’ve got rooms (apps, files, printers)  
You’ve got keys (permissions)  
And you’ve got people with job roles

You wouldn’t hand out keys one at a time.  
You’d issue team badges. Maybe special access for managers.

That’s all group-based access is. And when you build it properly, it scales with your business — automatically.

---

## What a Clean Tenant Looks Like

You don’t need 30 groups. You need a few that match real business roles:

- `Staff_Core` – Teams, Email, Shared Drive  
- `Finance` – Xero, finance documents  
- `Sales` – CRM, proposal templates  
- `Directors` – Strategic docs, reports  
- `Contractors` – 1–2 apps max, time-limited  
- `Printers` – Managed centrally by group

Most SMBs could run their whole IT system with 6–10 core groups, if done right.

## Dynamic Groups Make It Even Cleaner

Most businesses don’t fill in user properties like *department* or *title*. But when they do, it unlocks real automation.

Set `Department = Finance`, and a dynamic group can auto-add that user to the `Finance` group. Access just works.  
Move them to HR? The system removes their old access, no tickets required.

🛠 Yes, it takes some effort up front. But you’ll save dozens of tickets and headaches later — and you’ll be able to scale without chaos.

---

## Nested Groups: Simplicity That Scales

Let’s say you’ve got three layers in Sales:

- Sales Reps  
- Sales Managers  
- Sales Director  

They all need CRM. But only managers need pipeline access. And only the director gets strategic data.

Instead of managing each separately, nest your groups:

- `Sales_All` – base access (CRM)  
- `Sales_Managers` – inherits `Sales_All`, adds reporting  
- `Sales_Director` – inherits `Sales_Managers`, adds strategy docs

Now when someone gets promoted, you move them up a level — they inherit what they need and nothing more.

---

## Build from the Bottom Up

Even your most basic roles benefit from structure:

- `Employees` → basic access: email, Teams, intranet  
- `Sales` → inherits from `Employees`  
- `Sales_Managers` → inherits from `Sales`  
- `Sales_Director` → inherits from `Sales_Managers`

One property — `Department` — drives it all. The system handles the rest.

---

## Shared App Sets: Cross-Department Grouping

Some teams don’t fit neatly into departments. Designers, for example, might need:

- Adobe Creative Cloud  
- Figma  
- Local admin rights  
- Access to a shared media NAS

Rather than building a special case into the `Marketing` group, create a standalone `Design_Suite` group. Add it to whoever needs it — without breaking your structure.

This also works for:

- Remote support tools  
- Elevated admin roles  
- Shared compliance or reporting tools

---

## Better Structure = Better Security

Structure isn’t just tidy — it’s secure.

When you assign access through groups, you can:

- Apply Conditional Access rules by role, not device  
- Scope Intune policies with zero manual touch  
- Track access changes cleanly  
- Avoid forgotten high-permission accounts

It also makes compliance simpler.  
You’ll know who had access, when, and why — without digging through outdated notes or old admin changes.

## Real-World Table Example

| Group             | Inherits From     | Access                              |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Employees         | —                 | Email, Teams, Intranet              |
| Sales             | Employees         | CRM, Sales Share                    |
| Sales_Managers    | Sales             | Pipeline Dashboards                 |
| Sales_Director    | Sales_Managers    | Strategy Reports                    |
| Finance           | Employees         | Xero, Finance Drive                 |
| Design_Suite      | —                 | Adobe, Figma, Media NAS             |
| Contractors       | —                 | One App, Expires in 30 Days         |

- ✅ Predictable, auditable access  
- ✅ Lower ticket volume  
- ✅ Stronger security posture  
- ✅ Simpler license assignment  
- ✅ Faster compliance reporting

## Where Most Businesses Get Stuck

> “But we’ve always done it this way…”  
> “We don’t have time to clean it all up…”  
> “It’s not broken, so why fix it?”

Here’s why:  
Without structure, every little change chips away at your IT until it becomes fragile, slow, and expensive.

You don’t have to fix everything overnight. Start small:

- Audit your groups  
- Standardise departments and titles  
- Create dynamic groups for 1–2 key teams  
- Map out access from the user’s perspective

Small wins compound. Structure builds momentum.

## Final Thought

Clean IT doesn’t mean minimal features. It means minimal confusion.

Start with what your business actually does.  
Build from the roles that already exist.  
Let the system do the heavy lifting.

**Less firefighting. Fewer mistakes. More time to move forward.**
